# Image-Annotation-Tools
We are introducing a number of image annotation tools in this page and explaining our experience in using them. Some of these tools are designed for specific types of images and some are general. 

<h3> ASAP </h3>
<p> 
ASAP is short form of Automated Slide Analysis Platform and is generally used in annotating histopathological Images or what is know as Whole Slide Images (WSI). This tool is available for download for both Windows and Linux users at <a href="https://github.com/computationalpathologygroup/ASAP/releases" target="_blank">here</a>. It lets the users to draw different shapes on the slide images including multipart non-convex polygons. The output format of this tools is human-readable XML. In the following figure you can see an example of a complex annotation drawn on a WSI of a breast tissue.

<h4>Pros and Cons<\h4>
<p>
  One of the advantages of ASAP is its readable output. It is organized in an XML file which is easily readable and interpretable by human users. It also has the capability of grouping a number of annotations (polygons for example) together which is useful in histopathological analysis of WSIs.

<h3> VIA </h3>
<p> 
VIA stands for VGG Image Annotator and is developed by the same researchers who introduced the VGG neural network. This tool is a general purpose tool for annotating images. It should be note that the newer version of this tool is capable of annotating videos and audios as well as images.
